## FRC 2020 - Infinite Recharge

**Project description:** This was my fourth and final year participating in FRC. This year, I stepped down from the Head of Outreach position as I had become the Captain of Galileo Robotics, as well as the Programming Lead during the fall semester. Being captain brought interesting challenges, as I was now in charge of most of the organization and day-to-day planning for the team. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent shift to online learning, we were unable to finish our robot or compete with it at all, and it remained in storage for over a year.

### 1. This Year's Game

In the 2020 FRC season, the game was called "Infinite Recharge" and had a Star Wars theme. Two alliances of three robots raced to shoot "power cells" (6" diameter foam balls) into any of three scoring areas. Scoring more power cells activates a "shield generator", at which point a "control panel" can be rotated by a specified amount of times or to a specific color to gain more points. At the end of a match, robots travel to their alliance's rendezvous point to onto a large, hanging balance to score points, scoring more points if the balance is level. As in previous games, the first 15 seconds of the match are autonomous and robots score extra points, before human drivers can take over and control their robots directly. 

### 2. Our Team's Approach To The Challenge
Our robot this year was sadly unfinished due to the COVID-19 pandemic preventing us from continuing to work on it past mid-March 2020. However, we were still able to make significant progress on construction before the sudden cancellation of the 2020 FRC season. We designed an electrically powered intake as well as a "conveyer belt" system to grab power cells and feed them into a motor-powered launcher. The robot also included a gear-shifting drive train, to allow for faster speeds or higher motor torque depending on which application we desired at the moment. In addition, our robot was also designed to turn the control panel and climb. The solution for accomplishing both these tasks was to have an elevator with a motor-powered roller mounted on the end; this accomplished the goals of both being able to turn the control panel and being able to position the robot while on the hanging balance to make it level in order to score more points.

### 3. Our Performance At Competitions

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we tragically couldn't compete in the 2020 FRC competition.
