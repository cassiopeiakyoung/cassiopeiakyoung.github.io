**Project description:** Circle Clicker Classic was one of the first projects that I worked on using Java, aside from small snippets of code that I wrote to solve problems on Codingbat.com. I wrote the game using the <a href = "https://processing.org/">Processing</a> IDE, a tool for beginning programmers, in about two hours. It was inspired by "clicker" games like <a href = "https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker">Cookie Clicker</a>, which is evident in its name and gameplay.

**Gameplay:** Circle Clicker Classic is a simple point-and-click game featuring a circle that moves around to random positions. Clicking on the circle increases the player's score, and high scores are saved using a write-to-file and load-from-file feature. The circle starts at a certain size and only moves every 2 seconds, but it shrinks and moves around faster as time goes on. It lacks many of the features of the current Circle Clicker, like golden circles, an item/upgrade shop or even an option to play again (one has to close the program and open it again).
