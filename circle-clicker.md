## Circle Clicker

**Project description:** Circle Clicker was one of the first projects that I worked on using Java, aside from small snippets of code that I wrote to solve problems on Codingbat.com. I wrote the game using <a href = "https://processing.org/">Processing</a>, a tool for beginning programmers, in about four hours.

**Gameplay** Circle Clicker is a simple point-and-click game featuring a circle that moves around to random positions. Clicking on the circle increases the player's score, and high scores are saved using a write-to-file and load-from-file feature. The circle starts at a certain size and only moves every 2 seconds, but it shrinks and moves around faster as time goes on.
