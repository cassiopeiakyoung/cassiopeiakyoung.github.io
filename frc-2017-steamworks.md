## FRC 2017 - FIRST Steamworks

**Project description:** This was my first year participating in FRC and the robot we built this year was the first robot I helped build. 

### 1. This Year's Game

In the 2017 FRC season, the game was called "Steamworks" and had a steampunk theme. Two alliances of three robots each competed to launch "fuel" (3-inch wiffle balls) into the "boilers" and deliver large plastic gears to the "airships" (large scoring areas in the middle of the field) for points. At the end of the match, teams could climb a rope up to the "airship" for additional points. Special ranking points would be awarded for filling up the "boilers" to a certain extent, delivering enough gears to the "airship" to allow all its rotors to spin, and for having all three robots climb up to the "airship" at the end of the match.

### 2. Our Team's Approach To The Challenge

Our team went for a "jack-of-all-trades" design. Our robot was designed to place gears, shoot balls into the "boilers", and also climb onto the airship at the end of the match. Achieving all this required a complex design, and the 2017 robot remains one of our more complex builds. We decided to use a simpler design for receiving and placing gears onto the airship in order to concentrate on improving our fuel launcher more. We also utilized a somewhat simple design for climbing the rope onto the airship at the end of the game; a small motor turned a "comb" that would catch on to a rope and pull the robot up.

### 3. Our Performance At Competitions

We had a somewhat mediocre season in 2017. We were able to attain a rank of 24 out of 41 teams in the San Francisco Regional and a rank of 42 out of 56 teams in the Silicon Valley Regional.
