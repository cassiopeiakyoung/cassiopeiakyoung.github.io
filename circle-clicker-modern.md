**Gameplay:** Circle Clicker Modern has a variety of upgrades and enhancements compared to its predecessor. In addition to regular white circles, there are "Golden Circles" that appear sometimes and grant the player "Upgrade Points". These "Upgrade Points" can be spent in the item shop for various upgrades. <br><br>

**Notes**
* Hard Mode is not currently implemented — purchasing it is a waste of 5,000 points at the moment
* When you are done playing, exit via the "Quit" button or **your game will not be saved!**
* When you download, open the folder and open the application called "CircleClickerModernAlpha1.0-Win32" (or -Win64 depending on the version you download) in order to play Circle Clicker.
