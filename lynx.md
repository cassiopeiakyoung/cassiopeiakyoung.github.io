## Little Lynx

**Project Description:** Inspired by my 2022 summer internship, I designed an Arduino optical camera wildfire detection and weather detection suite. It takes pictures of its surroundings at certain intervals, pushes it to the Robotics Cats API, then notifies the specified phone number if a wildfire was detected in the image.
