## Little Lynx

**Project Description:** Inspired by my 2022 summer internship projects, I designed an Arduino optical camera wildfire detection and weather detection suite. It takes pictures of its surroundings at certain intervals, pushes it to the Robotics Cats API through a 3G connection, then notifies the specified phone number if a wildfire was detected in the image. It also includes the bearing and tilt of the image as well as the local weather in the notification.

**Components used:**
 - OV7670 camera module
 - DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
 - MPU6050 6-axis accelerometer
 - Compass module
 - 3G SIM card module
 - Elegoo Uno R3
 - Miscellaneous resistors, jumper wires, breadboards
