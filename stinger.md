## The Stinger

**Project Description:** The Stinger is a small repeating bolt-action penny launcher, with a removable and reloadable cartridge. I designed it and animated the gif below entirely in Solidworks, and manufactured it via additive manufacturing processes.

### Using the Stinger

1. Place rubber bands connecting the barrel and the bolt (this powers the launcher).
2. Assemble the cartridge by connecting the top and bottom pieces with rubber bands (this brings the pennies up).
3. Load pennies into the cartridge, then load the cartridge into the grip.
4. Pull the bolt back until a penny is loaded into the barrel.
5. Aim (away from anything breakable or anything alive!) and pull the trigger.
