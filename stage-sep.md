## Stage Separation Vehicle

**Project description:** This was my first year participating in Space Technologies and Rocketry at Berkeley. I joined the SSEP (Stage Separation Vehicle) team, concerned with designing, fabricating and flying a 9.6' tall, two-stage solid-fueled rocket. The SSEP vehicle consists of a lower stage rocket that lifts a smaller rocket to a predetermined height and altitude before running out of fuel and releasing the upper stage rocket to ignite its motor and continue flying. Both stages are recovered by deploying a parachute at their apogee (highest point), and are currently being fabricated with a late April 2022 planned launch date.

### My Contributions to the SSEP Project Team

I worked primarily on redesigning the lower stage and interstage avionics bay for the SSEP vehicle in order to accommodate the needs of the airframe team as well as the avionics team in order to allow for proper installation inside the cramped interior of the rocket, and also ensure that our avionics sensors had redundancies to ensure proper deployment of the upper stage and parachutes for recovery. I also coordinated with the team members in charge of electronics to ensure wires would have sufficient space to travel through various bulkheads to reach the motors and separation charges from the avionics bays. In addition, I made various miscellaneous adjustments to other portions of the rocket, including various U-bolts and a counterweight set in the nose cone to aid in flight stability. All of these adjustments were made in Solidworks and Grabcad to aid collaboration.

As this was my first year attending college in person rather than over Zoom, I was able to help actually fabricate the parts used in the SSEP vehicle. We used a variety of fabrication methods including 3D printing, laser cutting and waterjet cutting to create the parts used in the rocket.
