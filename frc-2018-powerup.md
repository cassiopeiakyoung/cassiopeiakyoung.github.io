## FRC 2018 - FIRST POWER UP

**Project description:** This was my second year participating in FRC. This year I was the Head of Outreach at Galileo Robotics, a role that previously hadn't existed. 

### 1. This Year's Game

In the 2018 FRC season, the game was called "FIRST POWER UP" and had a retro video game theme. Two alliances of three robots each competed to place "power cubes" (milk crates with FIRST-branded fabric covers) onto two scales of different heights. When the scale tipped in a certain direction, one alliance would receive points for every second the scale was tipped in their favor. Three sets of scales were on the field: the large one in the middle granted 1 point per second for the alliance that had "ownership" of the scale, while the two small ones, called switches, close to the starting area granted points only to the alliance closest to it (though the other alliance could take "ownership" of the switch to prevent points from being gained). Power cubes could also be placed into a "receiving" area on each alliance's side and could then be "spent" by a human player for various power-ups for use in the game. Three power-ups existed: "Force", which gave an alliance "ownership" of their switch, the scale, or both the switch and scale, depending on how many power cubes were "spent"; "Boost", which doubled the points the alliance scored by the switch, scale, or both, again depending on how many power cubes were "spent"; and "Levitate", which required three power cubes to use but gave one alliance robot a free climb at the end of the match. In the end of every match robots had an opportunity to climb a bar for more points. 

### 2. Our Team's Approach To The Challenge

Our team again went for a "jack-of-all-trades" design. We designed our robot with an elevator so it could score points in all three locations - the switch, the scale and the vault. Our gripper, used for holding on to the power cubes, utilized a wheeled intake design: a motor spun green compliant wheels (squishy plastic wheels) to grip the power cubes and hold them while our robot drove to the scale, switch or vault. Our elevator also carried a hook which was attached to three Kevlar cables, which were attached to motors that would pull the robot up in the last few seconds of the match.

### 3. Our Performance At Competitions

We had a moderately successful 2018 season. In the San Francisco regional we achieved a rank of 43, placing us near the bottom of the leaderboard. But we turned this around at the Silicon Valley regional, and achieved a final rank of 14 there.
