## MarkerBot 2000

**Project Description:** MarkerBot 2000 is a relatively small robot that can drive around and draw on various surfaces using an attached marker. It can also selectively raise and lower its marker to either draw or not draw. I designed, built and programmed  MarkerBot during a six-week summer internship at the UCSF Makers Lab along with a fellow intern. Our goal while building MarkerBot was to create something to help beginner programmers learn how to code. In my personal experience, some people are turned away from computer programming when first learning since it is somewhat difficult for one to see what they are coding. MarkerBot 2000 provides a way to visualize and interact with the results of one's programs.
### Using MarkerBot

MarkerBot has two modes: a [remote-control mode](/markerbot/markerbot-remote-control-guide), where MarkerBot can be controlled through a tethered controller, and an [autnomous mode](/markerbot/autonomous-control-guide), where Arduino code can be uploaded to MarkerBot so it can move and draw autonomously. A troubleshooting guide and instructions to using MarkerBot can be downloaded <a href="/downloads/MarkerBotGuide.docx" download>here</a>.
