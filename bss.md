## Bike Security System

**Project description:** This is a bike-mounted security system. It uses a 3-axis accelerometer and Hall effect sensors to detect motion of the bike when it is armed, and then uses facial detection algorithms with an ESP32-CAM to detect a thief and spray them with pepper spray.
