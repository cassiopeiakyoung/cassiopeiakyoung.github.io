## FRC 2019 - Destination: Deep Space

**Project description:** This was my third year participating in FRC. This year I was the Head of Outreach and Mechanical Team Lead at Galileo Robotics. Being Mechanical Team Lead brought with it unique challenges like having to train new recruits to work together effectively as a team and teach them the skills they needed to build a robot. While these challenges were tough to overcome, they helped me grow as a person as I learned how to be a more effective leader and teacher. I also became more committed to the team than ever before, and started going to meetings six days a week for at least three hours a day.
### 1. This Year's Game

In the 2019 FRC season, the game was called "Destination: Deep Space" in honor of the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landings. Two alliances of three robots raced to place "hatch panels" (polycarbonate rings with Velcro on their edges) and "cargo pieces" (large rubber balls) into three scoring zones, the "cargo ship" in the center of the field and the two "rockets" on either side of the field. Hatch panels and cargo pieces could be loaded by a member of the drive team from each alliance's wall. Unlike most years, there was no period of time where the robots had to perform autonomously; instead, for the first 15 seconds driver vision was obscured by a "sandstorm", forcing drivers to rely on camera vision, autonomous programming, or simply drive blind. Robots started in a "HAB zone" and could start on Level 1 or Level 2; starting on Level 2 granted more points than Level 1 if the robot was able to drive off in the sandstorm period. Towards the end of the match, robots could climb the "HAB" for additional points: a Level 3 climb granted 12 points, a Level 2 climb granted 9 points, and a Level 1 "climb" (since getting onto Level 1 required simply driving up a ramp) granted 3 points. Special points called ranking points were awarded for placing all hatch panels and cargo pieces in a rocket and for gaining 15 total points from climbing the "HAB" at the end of the match.

### 2. Our Team's Approach To The Challenge
Again, we approached the challenge with a jack-of-all-trades design. Our robot consisted of a drive train using special wheels called mecanum wheels that allowed us to strafe side to side, unlike previous designs that could only drive in one direction and turn. This design improved our mobility and helped greatly when placing hatch panels and cargo pieces. We designed a robotic arm so it could reach up to the highest part of the rocket and place panels and cargo there. To grab onto hatch panels and cargo, we used a reversible "hand" - one side had attachments to grab cargo while the other side had attachments to grab hatch panels. This hand was pneumatically actuated and relied on pressurized air to function. Finally, our robot used a double-elevator design to be able to climb up to the HAB's Level 3 at the end of the match. Both elevators would push down to push our robot up, then wheels on the elevator's bottom would drive the edge of our robot to the ledge. The elevator closest to the ledge would retract, and our robot would drive on to the ledge. Then, the second elevator would retract, leaving our robot safely on the 3rd level.

### 3. Our Performance At Competitions

We had a very successful 2019 season. In the San Francisco regional competition, technical issues caused our robot to not perform as well as we had hoped, and we achieved a rank of 33 there. However, by the time of the Silicon Valley regional, these technical issues were fixed. As a result, we performed better than we ever had in any previous competition, and ranked high enough to have a guaranteed spot in the quarterfinals. Unfortunately we lost both our quarterfinal matches and could not proceed any further, but we ended up with a final rank of 7 - the highest rank we've ever achieved!
