## RoboSub 2021

**Project description:** This was my first year participating in RoboSub. As a member of the Business & Operations Team as well as the Mechanical Team of Underwater Robotics at Berkeley, I had to manage my responsibilities in both of those teams. I learned a lot about managing finances for the team as a Business & Operations member as well as designing parts and stress-testing them in Solidworks as a Mechanical member. Despite the fact that the year's competition was held entirely online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I was able to have an immersive, in-depth experience and can't wait to experience the RoboSub 2022 competition!

### 1. This Year's Game

The 2021 RoboSub competition was held entirely online. Despite this, RoboSub provided concrete instructions to teams on what should be accomplished by each team's underwater ROV. The ROV was to maneuver around underwater and through an obstacle course, shoot torpedos at provided targets, and pick up markers with a robotic claw.

### 2. My Contributions to the Mechanical Team

I ensured the delivery robotic claw in Solidworks to manipulate and pick up markers while underwater, and additionally ran stress tests on the components of the claw I judged most likely to fail. The claw went through multiple iterations, and the final iteration cost less than half that of the original design's cost. The final iteration is pictured above; it uses a BlueRobotics M200 motor, as it is waterproof and designed to run underwater, in conjunction with a series of gears and plates to open and close, causing a grasping motion for the claw.
